# Introduction

This project explores movie industry data from IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes to determine which types of movies have been most successful. The hypothetical context for 
this analysis is that Microsoft is interested in creating and selling original video content. The company has hired a team of analysts to inform their decisions 
about the types of films it should create. The project consist of an analytical component, visualizations, and a presentation of the findings for non-technical 
audiences.

# Questions

The analysis will aim to address three questions about the movie industry:
1. What types of movies (genre and content rating) are the most popular?
2. What are the highest-grossing movie genres?
3. What is the ideal range for movie runtimes, in terms of profitability? 

# Data

### IMBD
The analysis explores a merged form of two IMBD datasets: one which contains data on domestic and foreign grossses, and one with data on runtimes and genres. 

### Rotten Tomatoes
To address the question about movie popularity, the IMBD data is supplemented with two datasets from Rotten Tomatoes, which contain data on movie ratings and 
reviews.
