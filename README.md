# Introduction

This project explores movie industry data from IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes to determine which types of movies have been most successful. The hypothetical context for 
this analysis is that Microsoft is interested in creating and selling original video content. The company has hired a team of analysts to inform their decisions 
about the types of films it should create. The project consist of an analytical component, visualizations, and a presentation of the findings for non-technical 
audiences.

# Questions

The analysis will aim to address three questions about the movie industry:
1. What types of movies (genre and content rating) are the most popular?
2. What are the highest-grossing movie genres?
3. What is the ideal range for movie runtimes, in terms of profitability? 

# Data

### IMBD
The analysis explores a merged form of two IMBD datasets: one which contains data on domestic and foreign grossses, and one with data on runtimes and genres. 

### Rotten Tomatoes
To address the question about movie popularity, the IMBD data is supplemented with two datasets from Rotten Tomatoes, which contain data on movie ratings and 
reviews.

> The highest-grossing movies had runtimes that were above the average for all movies.

# Recommendations

### Genres
Microsoft should create adventure, comedy, sci-fi and western films. Adventure and comedy films are both in the top 5 highest-grossing genres, in terms of both average and total gross numbers. Western and sci-fi films are more rare, but have highly competitive average gross values.

### Content Ratings
The most well-reviewed films have either no rating or a G-Rating. Microsoft should make unrated and G-rated movies.

### Runtimes
Microsoft’s ideal runtime range is between 110 and 140 minutes. The average runtime for the highest-grossing films is just over 2 hours, which suggests that this may be the “sweet spot” for many audiences.
